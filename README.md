No documentation so far. Please look in the two scripts for more information.

These scripts are not supported in any way whatsoever.

You can run the webhook from a cron job or something. The bot needs to be kept running to connect to Discord.


rename config_example.ini to config.ini and supply the required configuration parameters.
